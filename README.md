# SCFTool

Hello, I'm Farid Rid or better known as @Revolution2022 on Telegram.

SCF Tool is a Secret Collecting File written using Batch Script as a hobby on January 9, 2013 as a mere hobby.

SCF Tool aims to collect several file formats that I have set just pressing the number button.

After several years of updating the code, I hereby announce the SCF Tool source code to the public. It is good for everyone to use for personal or commercial improvement and use.

The last update was made on May 15, 2021 with version 22.1 and the update has officially been terminated.
